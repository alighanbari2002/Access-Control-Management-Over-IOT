#### 1. We can use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Each employee can carry a beacon, and a Bluetooth receiver at the entrance can detect these beacons when they come within range. The beacon’s ID can serve the same purpose as the RFID tag’s ID in current setup.The rest of the steps are the same as before, and after receiving the information from BLE, we can make a request to the web server.

#### 2.Yes, it is possible with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE support data transfer without pairing. BLE allows for “advertisements”, which are small packets of data that can be broadcasted to any device within range. This can be used to transmit a personal ID. However, this method lacks the security provided by pairing.The reader at the entrance can detect these broadcasts and identify employees based on their unique IDs. 

#### 3.Instead of using a timer, we can use a proximity-based solution. With Bluetooth, we can estimate the distance between two devices based on the signal strength (RSSI). We can program the door to close when the Bluetooth signal strength indicates the user has moved a certain distance away from the door. This would make the system more dynamic and responsive to the user’s movements. However, please note that this method might not be as accurate as other methods due to the nature of Bluetooth signal propagation.
